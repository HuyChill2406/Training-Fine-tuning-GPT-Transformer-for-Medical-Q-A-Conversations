ok, i think i was in about 7th grade, i was walking you know slow and
easy down the hall and up the stairs, i dont know why but as soon as i
sit down my heart started pounding and i could feel it like it was
going to come out of my chest what could this be?

REFERENCE ANSWER:
Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I
would like to explain that your pounding heart feeling (that is
palpitations), is among the most common heart related complains. It
may be caused by just by an increased anxious state, is also a common
finding during and after any physical exertions. These above options
are almost physiological conditions, and you shouldn't worry about.
But, we have to be sure no any other pathological reasons is
responsible, first of all any arrhythmias. So, a careful physical
exam, coupled with a resting ECG, and if suspicions are raised for a
possible arrhythmia, a cardiac ultrasound and an ambulatory 24 to 48
hours ECG monitoring are necessary. Several blood tests (complete
blood count to exclude a possible anemia; thyroid hormone levels to
exclude a possible high abnormal thyroid function; PCR to exclude any
inflammations, etc.). Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!

MODEL ANSWER:
Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have
gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are
going through. The heart beating is not related to your weight loss.
It is related to the fact that you are not active. So, if you are not
active then it is not related to your weight loss. So, you can try to
lose weight by doing exercise and avoiding stress. If you still have
any doubts then you can close the discussion and rate the answer. I
hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query,

from what information I gave you. I made a dentist appointment with my
local dentist but I rather know now what it could be as it makes me
wonder let alone, worries me before my appointment. Thanks you, Chris

REFERENCE ANSWER:
Hello, You have done the right thing by making an appointment with
your dentist. A broken tooth will need treatment. Treatment will
depend on how much of the tooth is broken. Your tooth will require a
restoration. Your dentist will suggest an x-ray to evaluate the extent
of tooth loss and the health of the root of your tooth. An untreated
broken tooth will usually continue to decay and can risk becoming
infected. Avoid chewing on the broken tooth.  Stay away from extreme
temperatures. You may be able to place a filling in the tooth. A crown
or only will be recommended if a large section of the tooth is
missing. If the nerve has been damaged, a root canal will be
recommended before restoring the tooth.  There may be additional
options depending on your diagnosis and your dentist will provide you
details and options after a clinical exam. Thank you and I hope you
feel better soon.

[13] QUESTION:
My mother is 74 years old and was very healthy until she was recently
diagnosed with a herniated disc caused by a fall. Since then she is
extremely fragile, she can t do regular activities such as getting up
off a chair or getting out of the car without help. During the last
week, we have noticed her memory is also affected. Forgetting to turn
off the oven, not knowing where an item came from, and even thanking
my father for running the vacuum (which he had not). She has an
appointment with a neurosurgeon at the end of August. Just wondering
if this memory loss could be caused by her spine issue. Thanks

REFERENCE ANSWER:
Hello; thanks for the query. Simple answer NO. Spine injuries will not
cause memory issues. But given her age 70+ years; these may easily be
senility related memory issues or onset of a process known as
dementia. You might have suddenly started noticing it as she has
recently suffered a fall & hence you are taking her health issues more
seriously than before; whereas there is a possibility that there might
be very subtle signs of memory difficulties over last 6 months to 1
year which might have gone unnoticed. Your description of her problems
seems more likely to be due to dementia (probably Steamers dementia).
Hence, get her evaluated by a Psychiatrist/Neurologist & start
appropriate treatment. Hope this helps. Good Luck

MODEL ANSWER:
Hello, As you said that she has a herniated disc, I would suggest that
you consult an orthopedic surgeon for the diagnosis of the same. She
should undergo a clinical examination of the disc, MRI of the lumbar
spine, TENS (traction of the nerves) and CT scan of the lumbosacral
spine to see if there is any degeneration of the disc. Also, she
should undergo a physical therapy session for her. I would also
suggest that you consult with a neurologist for the same. Hope I have

[14] QUESTION:
I was told that I am in the early stages of emphysema this week at the
VA hospital where I go for various treatments, I also did not do very
well on the exhaling portion of the breathing test I took for them. I
am 72 years old and have been smoking off and on for approx. 40 years.
The last startup,after a 12 year break, was 9 years ago after my wife
passed away. CURRENTLY I DON T SMOKE A LOT ,5 A DAY. What is your best
estimate for how long I have left?

REFERENCE ANSWER:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Emphysema is an older term.
Nowadays COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) term is used. It
includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. And COPD is
progressive disease. We have to manage it to halt the progression of
the disease. So better term for COPD is chronic manageable disease.
Lifelong treatment is needed. And for this you should consult
pulmonologist and get done PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to know the
exact severity of the disease.  As treatment of COPD is based on
severity of it. You need to follow below-mentioned steps
simultaneously for effective treatment. 1. Quit smoking as soon as
possible. 2. Start inhaled bronchodilators3. Enroll in pulmonary
rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing
exercise are done. 4. Get done vaccination with pneumococcal and
influenza vaccines for prevention of future lung infections. If you
strictly follow these life expectancy will be very good.

MODEL ANSWER:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Emphysema is a condition where the lungs
become inflamed and can lead to chronic bronchitis, pneumonia,
bronchitis secondary to lung infection, pneumonia, lung cancer and
lung infections. You should visit your doctor to rule out all the
above causes. You should also get evaluated for lung infection and
other diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis secondary to lung infection
and pneumonia. You should also get tested for blood for lung infection
and bronchitis. It is important to get your blood tests done and start

[15] QUESTION:
My 37 year old son in law was found passed out and had started turning
blue by the time medics got to him and got him awake. He was
transported to the hospital where they kept him overnight. Their
diagnosis was a possible seizure causing oxygen deprivation. This
occurred last Tuesday, 1/30. Tonight while out shopping with his wife
he got very confused, told her there were people in the car with them
and he s been very tired, falling asleep sitting up. Could this be
from the lack of oxygen or something else going on.

REFERENCE ANSWER:
I read your question and I understand your concern. Confusion and
feeling of passing out can be a seizure manifestation. It is not clear
whether he had any tests done after his first seizure (from your
description a generalized seizure). Seizures in an adult must be
investigated after as usually there is a cause behind them. So apart
from some routine blood tests he should have examination with MRI to
look for brain lesions (tumor, stroke, infection etc.) and EEG to
search for epileptic activity, location and type. Other exams may be
needed at times depending on the physical and imaging exams findings.
The fact that he's having these episodes reinforces the need for more
exams. Treatment will be directed towards the cause and anti-epileptic
treatment if necessary. The lack of oxygen described to you has been
suggested as a result of the generalized seizure with temporary
breathing interruption, as a secondary sign, not as a cause of the
seizure. I hope to have been of help.

MODEL ANSWER:
Hi...by what you quote I feel that he is having an acute episode of an
episode of a seizure. Usually seizure symptoms are self limiting and
do not require any medication at all. But if the patient is having
sudden jerky movements or a sudden increase in heart rate or blood
pressure values (which are not known to be related to seizure) then it
may be a sign of a seizure. I suggest you to consult your attending
physician and get evaluated. I do hope that your kid is having a good
day. Wishing him/her a speedy recovery.

test done, on a safer side I will advise you to have a checkup again
with your clinical signs and symptoms. Usually, neck pain cannot be
due to initiative of the stroke but still judging is not possible
until a thorough clinical examination is done. You can try doing some
breathing exercises by which the muscles of neck relax. Also, such
forceful exertion out of nose may not lead to any neck injuries either
until the head is shaken up badly. Having a check by clinical
examination is not at all a bad thing to do. RegardsJay In Chat
Doctor.

MODEL ANSWER:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, In my opinion you should consult your
doctor and go for CT scan of your head. It will give you an idea about
the nature of the stroke and treatment will be planned accordingly. If
you are having any symptoms like fever, headache, chest pain,
dizziness, head ache, loss of consciousness, body aches and so on then
you should go for a Neurologist consultation. You can take Tylenol or
ibuprofen to reduce the pain. Hope this answers your query. If you
have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not
hesitate in writing to us. I

[23] QUESTION:
I have a burning sensation in the lower left abdominal area.The pain
is intermittent it varies in intensity. I work in a physically
demanding field..Ive had a hernia on the right side years ago..The
pain will go away then if irritate it , the burning can be almost
debilitating. ..Any Ideas.?????

REFERENCE ANSWER:
Hello! Thank you for the query. As you have had hernia on the right
side, there is a possibility that the same issue is on the other side.
Please note that hernia indicates weak connective tissue. Some persons
have it weaker and are prone to hernia. The other possible reasons of
lower left abdominal pain are diverticulitis (possible if you have
constipation), urinary tract infection (frequent urinating, burning
while urinating should be present), ovaries cyst (if you are female).
I suggest you to have some basic tests. Abdominal ultrasound, blood
work, urinalysis should be done at first. If diverticulitis is
possible, colonoscopy should be considered. Hope this will help.
