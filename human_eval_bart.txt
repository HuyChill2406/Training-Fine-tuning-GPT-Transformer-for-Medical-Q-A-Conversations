I have low IgA and IgM. I have fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and had

take more of green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits and Chat Doctor. .

[06] QUESTION:
So I have for pretty much three weeks, and I have taken care of myself
and my body pretty well since I was diagnosed. But last night I was
around a few friends at their house and the were smoking cannabis out
of a tobacco paper a few times while I was there, but I did not
partake in smoking but was sitting with them around second-hand smoke.
There wasn t a window in the house open, and I was with them for 12
hours. I feel absolutely stupid now, for being around the smoke!! Will
this worsen the pleurisy and should I go to the doctor and get checked
back out again for further damage to my lungs? I thought if I couldnt
feel the effects from being around the smoke it wouldnt affect the
pleurisy, but man was I wrong at least I think?! PLEASE HELP!

REFERENCE:
Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. Second
hand marijuana smoke can produce a very small high(contact high) in
people, around those who are smoking. The high that the non-smoking
individual feels is said to be caused by the smoke that is in the
room.However, second hand marijuana smoke is unlikely to have any
effect on pleurisy for that matter to worsen it. Significant
decrements in pulmonary vital capacity have been found in regular
daily marijuana smokers and marijuana smokers may develop bronchial
irritation. Whether second hand marijuana smoke will affect by-
standers lung similarly await study replication and confirmation.

[08] QUESTION:
I had a friend who lost her mom suddenly within a few hours of
awakening with no signs of distress prior. She had Alzheimer s with
hex of CAD and was bed bound so unable to express needs. She had been
coughing some early that morning so she gave her levsin for secretions
the dr had ordered months back. Two hous later upon awakening, she
found her mom passed away on her back with frothy white foamy
secretions in her mouth. She needs closer with what happened. She
asked around and people tell her heart attack or PE. Does this sound
correct?

REFERENCE:
I read your question carefully, and I am sorry about your friends'
loss. I agree with the people which have suggested an acute heart or
lung issue such as pulmonary embolism or heart attack, they can cause
such a clinical picture. An additional possibility I might add would
be also a stroke, a brain hemorrhage possibly with seizures which can
also cause that quick death and foam from her mouth. Of course these
are only speculations, without any witnesses and information about
onset and course only an autopsy can really make the diagnosis. I hope
to have been of help.

MODEL:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your friends
situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of
heart attack is more. But better to rule out cardiac cause first. So
get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these
are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes
stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So better to
consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to
identify stressor in her life and start working on its solution. You
may need anxiolytic

I have a small lump on lower backside of my head on the left side
about 1 inch above my hair line. It feels hard at touch and is size of
grape maybe a little smaller. the area is tender and when i noticed i
pushed on it and there was local pain. Any options on what this could
be.

REFERENCE:
Hello! Thank you for the query. At this location, sebaceous cyst is
the most probable reason of this lump. It's a benign soft tissues'
tumor filled with whitish masses. It does not turn into a cancer.
However, it may get infected. If so, it becomes tender, swollen.
Sometimes in mentioned location enlarged lymph node can also appear. I
suggest you to consult general surgeon with this issue. Soft tissues'
ultrasound should be done. Sebaceous cyst should be removed. If its
enlarged lymph node, biopsy should be considered. Hope this will help.

[10] QUESTION:
I have not had regular periods for the past 5 years since I went off
birth control after getting married. I am sexually active and we want
to get pregnant. No luck with over 4 years trying. I usually get
pretty normal period about every 2 or 3 months. My last one was around
Decmber 22nd lasting about 5 days average flow, using tampons and
pads. On this past Friday I had a cramp went to the bathroom and saw
little blood when I wiped, assuming that I was starting my period I
put on a tampon, left it in for about 6 hours only to pull it out
(very painfully) to notice there was little to no blood on it kind of
brownish. On Saturday I only bled enough to see a hint of pink when I
wiped and had a few bad cramps , then Sunday we even had sex and it
was like I was not even on my period. Today Monday I had a really bad
cramp went to the bathroom around 2pm and had some spotting. I put in
a softcup around 2:30 and left it in until 9pm and when I took it out
it only had a tiny amount of clear and brown liquid. Could I be
pregnant, or is this somthing else. I had blood work done last year to
make sure I was okay due to not getting prego for 4+year and irregular
periods and nothing came back unusual.

REFERENCE:
Hi, It looks like you are experiencing a breakthrough spotting, could
be premenstrual, as you usually have 2-3 month cycles. Though, it is
better to get a pregnancy test and a pelvic/trans-vaginal sonogram
done to see the cause of the spotting. You may see your health care
provider for a complete evaluation and also to help for conception as
you have already tried enough time for natural conception. Wish you
good health.

MODEL:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion you should
consult gynecologist for proper examination and proper treatment. You
have not mentioned your age and sex. If you are sexually active then
chances of pregnancy are very less. You can take progesterone for next
2 weeks. If it doesn't work then you can go for GUI. It will give you
exact idea. Then you can take treatment accordingly. Hope this helps.

My daughter is 7 years, her upper teeth has been loose since 4 months
ago but now is crooked, is having a huge space between the two front
teeth and her gums from the top are deollen and purple like a bruise .
She had shark teeth on the bottom teeth that she only had lost, but
seeing her gums turning purple- black is freaking me out

REFERENCE:
Hello there, Permanent teeth start erupting at the age of 6 years and
onwards, shark teeth or secreted teeth is the feature of milk teeth.
As your daughter is 7 years old her permanent teeth will replace the
milk ones. Visit a dentist for confirmation, x-ray examination will
show the underlying permanent tooth buds accordingly go for treatment
removal of teeth or to save the teeth. Cleaning of gums and a course
of medication will cure the swelling n redness of gums, take care.

MODEL:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The purple gums
could be because of the gum infection. Consult an oral physician and
get it evaluated. If it is gum infection then you need to take a

[13] QUESTION:
My girlfriend and I were fooling around on the 26th of june, then on
the 14th of  july she began spotting and finally got her period,  she
went through several pads but 2 days later it stopped then she began
spotting then it stopped again and it came back and stopped
again...now when we were fooling around we were trying anal and I
decided to wipe precum off of her butt, but I wiped back to front,
what are the chances of her getting pregnant or being pregnant?

REFERENCE:
Hi, Anal intercourse is not safe for having pregnancy. Even if you
have pre-cum, few sperms might have been there in pre-cum which may
travel into vagina and vaginal canal. In your case you have done wipe
off pre-cum from back to front which is again a risky thing as you
bring pre-cum nearer to vagina. Any way, wait till she gets period. If
she passes off 7-8 days of her expected period, then go for pregnancy
test. Ok and take care.

MODEL:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion the chances of
getting pregnant are very low. The chances of pregnancy are very less
in your girlfriend case. If she had unprotected sex on the 14th of
June, she might have got her period on the 15th of July. The chance of
pregnancy is very less if she has unprotected sex during this period.
If the period is delayed by more than a week, then she might be
pregnant. So do not worry about that. Hope this helps. Best regards...

REFERENCE:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Masturbation within limits is a safe and
pleasurable sexual activity enjoyed by most people. It is said that
masturbation is normal 2 to 3 times a week and up to once a day. This
basically releases sexual tension and is also lowers stress. Taking
healthy food is always good. Masturbation is a type of physical
exercise, but it should be done within limits. Masturbation becomes a
problem when done more than once daily and if your mind is busy with
thoughts of masturbation and sexual nature, and you are unable to
concentrate on your work and study. Going by your situation, at 24
years age you are certainly fit for marriage. Till you get married you
can masturbate 2 to 3 times a week as per your choice till you get
married. This is perfectly normal and acceptable male behavior.

REFERENCE:
Hi thereCharcot Marie Tooth(CMT) is also called Hereditary Motor and
sensory Neuropathy. There are 2 types. Type I is the most common and
the best way of testing for this disease is to do a nerve biopsy. We
usually take a segment of one of the expendable nerves(one you can
live without) commonly the rural nerve(taken from your leg)and sent to
the laboratory to check for CMT. However, this test is only conducted
for patients with symptoms suggestive of CMT. If no symptoms this test
can't be used for screening purpose.

abdomen along with radiating in your back and also had vomiting, and
you slightly relived on lying down and again having such a sever pain,

pain, which might be due to a stone in your left ureter. So it's my
opinion and suggestion to you that you must consult your nearby
urologist or get emergency treatment by undergoing first taking
analgesic Injection and followed by Ultrasonography of your abdomen

I ve been prescribed cerazette today, I m not due a period for at

[22] QUESTION:
i have been feeling some unusual gripping in my left face. the
gripping/numbness radiate twards my lips eyes, ear neck, occasionally
i feel the gripping in my arm towards my wrist. it comes and goes.
while present it seems to move and grip a particular place more
intensely than the other. i feel a slightly painful presure when it
grips my ears. it stiffens my neck. i sometimes feel it in my cheek or
lips.

REFERENCE:
Here you have symptoms of numbness on your face, eye and ears along
with the neck. But this is only one part of face that is right half of
face. As per the symptoms looks like either you have got issue close
to your ear with facial nerve which supplies the face muscles, or you
have issue with your neck cervical spine and nerves coming out from
this level. I suggest visiting an orthopedic because without doing
physical examination and some tests it's not possible to evaluate it.
Here orthopedic will check the symptoms and will evaluate it. If there
is no issue with facial nerve then you may need to go ahead with
cervical MRI scan and based in report he will suggest for the
medication and physiotherapy treatment for mild to moderate issues.
But if there is major damage to cervical spine which I feel there
won't be, then he may suggest for surgical correction and then
physiotherapy rehabilitation.However if there is problem with facial
nerve also you need to visit a physio for facial muscle exercises and
take advice on precautions like do not have anything cold food item
like ice cream, cold Chat Doctor.  As well keep ear bud when ever you
go out because the cold air should not go to your ear. And do not
sleep under AC or full speed fan. Apart from this you can also use hot
water bag for the place from where the pain starts. This will also
give you good relief. I have given here general guideline, but I am
sure it will be useful if you follow it well. Take care.

MODEL:
Hello, I have studied your case. Due to compression of nerve root

aspiration cytology to rule out any nerve compression. You may need to
take anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Hope this answers your query. If
you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not

[23] QUESTION:
I have an underactive thyroid - for many years I get a really dry
chocking cough. I have to get water and stop talking to rest the
throat. It then produces lots of mucus. This can happen at any time
out the blue, never when I am eating - maybe talking or even when I am
driving. I did ask my GP many years about it and he thought it was an
allegy but I disagree. When I have one of these coughing fits now it
is getting worse.

REFERENCE:
Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per
your query Chat Doctor.  You may have lung infection or bronchitis. I

should get an x-ray of the chest as well.  Doctor may order blood
test, throat swab test or virus culture test. Doctor may prescribe

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your
concern. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done
clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function
Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell
you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity
only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol
or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or
fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I
have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you
good health. Thanks.

[25] QUESTION:
How quickly will a patient with stage IV renal carcinoma deteriorate
when last hope drugs (Sutent) begin to fail?  Patient is 42 year old
male, has taken Sutent for 10 months with some tumour regression, but
recent scans show a reappearance of lung mets.

REFERENCE:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your
situation and problem. Honestly speaking, stage 4 renal cancer with
lung metastasis carries very bad prognosis. And failing chemotherapy
adds further poorer prognosis. So better to discuss end of life issues
with the patient. Start palliative treatment in the form of nutrition
and pain management. Life expectancy is less than 1 year. And five
year survival rate is very, very less (less than 10%).

MODEL:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your
concern. You have stage IV renal carcinoma.  It is stage 4 cancer.
Treatment of choice is chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Surgery is the
treatment of choice.  Consult your doctor and take treatment
accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt
then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you
a very good health.
