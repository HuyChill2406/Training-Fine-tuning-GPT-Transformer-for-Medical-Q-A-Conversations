[01] QUESTION:
my daughter gets small itchy bumps on her legs and arms. I noticed
only in the spring and we have had her tested for allergies and she
doesnt have any. The derm gave us some cream but it doesnt work and no
one can tell us what it is attributed to. She scratches and sratches
and now she has scars all over her legs.

REFERENCE:
Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your
history and would like to make suggestions for your daughter as
follows:1. Such small itchy bumps on legs and arms may be caused by
many factors such as particular type of clothes, sweating, exposure to
sunlight, exposure to cold/warm water, irritants in air, etc. etc.
Detailed history is required for identifying the cause. It is very
common to have such rashes without being allergic to any particular
substance.2. I usually suggest my such patients an antihistamines like
cetirizine or levocetirizine for itching and rash to be used on as-
and-when-needed basis.3. I would also suggest her to apply lotion such
as calamine over the itchy areas which would reduce itching.4. Please
make sure that she does not scratch the itchy areas as it would
aggravate itching and sometimes may cause long term damage to skin.
Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her. Should you have any
further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish her the
best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards.

[02] QUESTION:
My 68 yr old male friend was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 1 1/2
yrs ago. At the time he collapsed, was taken to the hospital and first
diagnosed as having a stroke. Later it was diagnosed as MS. He has no
use of his right arm and hand ( which is usually swollen) and drags
his right leg and foot when walking. He is also a controlled diabetic.
He is still not sure what he really has.

REFERENCE:
Hello! I read the question and understand your concern. A multiple
sclerosis is very exceptional to be diagnosed at this age. I don't
know the MRI pattern, but a stroke in a diabetic patient may be
misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis in MRI because of lacuna strokes
and periventricular post ischemic lesions. The difference may be done
by a contrast enhancement which is consists with multiple sclerosis.
The fact that the motor deficit is persistent is more consistent with
stroke than multiple sclerosis. I would recommend a lumbar puncture
with oligoclonal bands for diagnosis multiple sclerosis though not
always it results positive. I would recommend him to keep taking
aspirins and a stating as hypolipemiant to prevent a possible stroke.
The best control of diabetes would be very helpful. Thank you for
using Chat Doctor! Best wishes

[04] QUESTION:
Thank you. I have had a cough for 4 and 1/2 years. I have been to
several doctors and had several test done. They checked my Thyroid,
put a tube down my nose for 24 hours and monitored when I ate, drank,
and was at rest. One doctor said that I needed to have surgery on my
esophagus and then another doctor tells me that it is the cancer med
that I take for my breast cancer that I need to take for 1 and 1/2
years more. Another doctor said it is allergies and puts me on shots
and pills. I does not help. I cough so hard I through up, and I
sometimes feel like I am going to pass out. They have done chest
x-rays, blood work, and ultra sound on my thyroid and they did not
find any thing yet. Is there any thing that I can do or any test that
I can ask the doctors to run on me.

REFERENCE:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should
consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to
rule out bronchitis. As untreated bronchitis can cause chronic cough
(Chat Doctor. Breast cancer patient after chemotherapy and
radiotherapy can develop bronchitis. So possibility of radiation

[05] QUESTION:
I sometimes experience a tight knot-like sensation in the stomach
area, in the gap just underneath the breastbone, which often results
in me having slow, uncomfortable breathing, and feels like slow
suffocation. Is it likely to be food intolerance as it often happens
after eating cheese or chips, which I now try to eat in moderation.
Your opinion would be appreciated.

REFERENCE:
HI. This is intolerance to the cheese and chips. The motility of the
lower esophagus is affected to cause spasm and cause all the problems
you are suffering from. The first part of the treatment is stop eating
cheese and chips. Stop all those foods and beverages which you know
causes these symptoms. Take a PPI and Risperidone and antacids.

Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor .com. I had gone through your question I
can understand your concern about your sore mouth. As per your history
you only had a complaint of sore mouth. If it is only painful and no
other lesion associated you can use analgesics gel (DICLOFENAC gel).

infection). Or it can be any of the autoimmune disease too. You can

[12] QUESTION:
I have just found out my daughter aged 31 has had a catscan, then mri
with and without contrast resulting in the findings of a 3mm cyst in
her pituitary gland. 10 years ago they found she had had bleeding in
the brain from the pituitary gland. She is a lactating mother. I was
searching for some knowledge and found Rathicke . Her symptoms have
been a dull ache in the head, dizziness and she has almost passed out
a few times. This concerns me as she is a nurse and works with
newborns as lactation consultant. We are still waiting for the PCP to
get back to her.

REFERENCE:
Hello, I will suggest you to look for some other causes of these
symptoms as it's a very remote possibility for a very small pituitary
cyst (a 3 mm cyst). Mild headache dizziness and feeling of passing out
needs work up like checking her blood pressure, electrolyte (sodium
potassium magnesium and calcium levels) and then correlating it to a
primary disease of a Chat Doctor.  But this all needs a careful
detailed history and physical examination. Hope I have answered your
query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

[17] QUESTION:
For the last week I m itching like crazy in my knee pits, on the bony
parts of my hips, and my upper butt cheeks. There is no rash or bites.
Best I can figure is some kind of allergy , but why only in those
spots? It started around the time I ate raddiccio. I m not allergic to
anything else from the lettuce family, so that would be strange to be
allergic, but possible I guess.

REFERENCE:
Hello, Cruciferous (lettuce) vegetables such as cauliflower, radicchio
can have high levels of salicylate that can explain the itchy hives
that you are having. However, this is usually a secondary trigger for
people with idiopathic urticaria (medical term for red, itchy hives
that can feel swollen under the skin) and is occasionally generalized
(i.e., whole body may be involved in hives). I would not suggest going
on a strict low salicylate diet as it is a very difficult diet, but
you might want to stop radicchio in your diet and start taking either
cetirizine 10 mg (max twice daily) or Allegra 180 mg for the next 2-3
weeks until all the hives have cleared up. Sometimes the treatment
needs to be continued for 3 months so check with your doctor on the
right antihistamines. If you do not high levels of salicylate
sensitivity (i.e., can tolerate other foods high in salicylates) then
do NOT go on a strict low salicylate diet. Sometimes in people with
salicylate sensitivity, one may be able to tolerate some foods but not
others in the high salicylate list which may be the same with you.

[18] QUESTION:
Hello, i ve recently been experiencing Headaches (the headache felt
like it was right behind my eye but all the hedaches i ve ever felt
are like that) , Neck stiffness, and slightly in the back too and
today some pain when i tense the inner part of my thighs (the parts
that touch and rub sometimes but the kind of pain you get when you ve
done too much exercise). (In that order). My neck easily cracks when
slightly moved from left to right. My back i have to actually crack it
like normal people do by sitting down n twisting . Theres really not
that much pain unless i bend my neck/back in a certain ways and even
those pains are barley there and i think they only are there because
the excessive cracking. I ve recently turned 15. this problem started
this week starting with the headache. I had lower back pains on the
lower right side but that went away for while now. I don t think I
have Arthritis because i/m really young and i m not experiencing the
slightest bit of excruciating pain. But could this be the start of it?
Or is it just Headache and some stiffness cause of not sleeping
right/enough or eating right etc? I hope its not Arthritis.

REFERENCE:
Hello, With history, it does not sound to me that it is arthritis. So
you can be relaxed for the same.  Now the cracking sound is actually
the unlocking of the facet joints, which is once in while common for
some.  But if it is always associated with relief of back pain and
neck pain than it's a muscle weakness of the spinal column and an
exercise will be of good choice to work behind it. Headache can be
cervicogenic headache or due to stress as well. Since you are 15 and
having no major traumatic injuries I do not think you will have any
major symptoms. But you can get your eye checked once if anything
related to the same. Of course sleep is a must to look for, because if
you do not sleep well, the body will enter the fatigue state soon and
may lead to muscle weakness leading to pain.  At the age of 15 doing
regular physical aerobic exercises are recommended.  Because lack of
exercise can cause pain and aches, and at the age of 15 its is hardly
acceptable that one will have headaches and back pains. Hope I have
answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take
care Jay In Chat Doctor.

[21] QUESTION:
Yes, I recently started to have afib, It started last year, and
happened when I tried reducing my Bystolic to 2.5MG, I am now back to
5mg. In the past few weeks I have started to have afib more, with a
heart rate of 140. I am on a 21 day monitor. We thought it was alcohol
related, but this past Monday, I had episodes, and hadn t drank in two
days. The previous event was after 3 beers, on Saturday. All of the
events seem to be when I lay down. Can afib be caused by the stomach,
eating late?

was suffering from hypertension since 2 months( 130  and 95) doctor
has advised to take s numblo 5mg.please tell me how many months i have

REFERENCE:
Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor! I read your question and understand
your concern. I would like to explain that your systolic blood
pressure is within the highest normal limits, while your diastolic
blood pressure is slightly higher. Although the diastolic high blood
pressure is not lower risk factor for cardio-vascular disease
comparing to high systolic blood pressure, it is indicative of pre-
hypertension or hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure.
So treatment (nor pharmacological or/and pharmacological is
necessary). First I would recommend making some modifications to your
lifestyle: 1-Salt intake should be limited to approximately 5 to 6 g
per day2-You should avoid caffeine intake as much as you can3-You
should lose some weight. Body-mass index (BMI) should be reduced to 25
kg/m 2 and waist circumferences should be reduced to less than 102 cm
in men and less than 88 cm in women. If the above tips don't help
reduce your blood pressure to the goal of below 130/90 mm Hg, a
medical treatment should be started. I would recommend a thiamine
diuretic (HY Chat Doctor.  These are better treatment in first stage
hypertension. I also recommend performing some lab tests (complete
blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, thyroid
hormone levels, blood electrolytes), besides the physical examination
and resting ECG, to exclude other causes of secondary high blood
pressure before starting the therapy. Hope to have been of help!
Greetings!
