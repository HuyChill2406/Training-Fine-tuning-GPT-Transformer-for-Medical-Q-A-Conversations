[01] QUESTION:
Hi, my mother has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer, we are
awaiting the stage result. My father had kidney cancer and died, my
grandmother on my mothers side died of lung cancer and my grandfather
on my fathers side died of bowel cancer. I am very worried I will get
it too. Is there anyway i could be tested for this? I am 27 year old
female.

REFERENCE:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your
situation and problem. Cancers can be hereditary and runs in family.
But it is not always true. But chances of cancer is high if family
history of cancer is positive. You can do annual health check up every
year to detect cancer early. Health check up should contain1. Chest
x-ray for lung cancer2. PAP smear for cervical cancer.3. Ultrasound
examination of abdomen to rule out liver, stomach and kidney cancer.4.
Routine blood investigation like CBC (complete blood count) to rule
out blood cancer. So consult your nearby hospital and discuss these
tests. You can also get done genetic testing but very few centers are
doing this. No need to worry much as all offsprings don't develop
cancer.

Hi sir am Tanveer am 28years male from Bangalore i have a problem from
past1year that am not able to walk properly My walking frequency n The
speed has been reduced as compare to earlier i feel very pain in My
knees i have did lots of masturbation for a year like once in a day or
twice a day. What do u think is My problem is due to masturbation if
yes please please advice me and suggest me some good medicine and food
to gain again My stamina pls help me...

REFERENCE:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details.
Masturbation is healthy if done with moderation. For a teenager once a
day and for an adult up to 25 thrice a week ideal. Due to masturbation
we feel weak, as we feel weak after physical exercise. The tiredness
after masturbation should be cleared after a good rest. Nothing to
worry on that regard. Your knee pain should have some other reason
like arthritis. Please consult a physician for examination. Stamina is
related to frequent physical activities and not related to
masturbation. But you should know obsession and negative thinking
about sexual organs and sex itself could cause anxiety disorder. Take
care.  If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this

I was bitten by a stray cat last Thursday.  It swelled up and scabbed;
some redness but went away.  I now have been having bouts of hives all

weekend so maybe it could be the change in detergent?  I also am

REFERENCE:
Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. The condition you have
referred to is called Urticaria or hives. It's an allergic
manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain
substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling
over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history,
clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests
like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for
treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as
possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I
would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at
least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non-
responding cases there are many other Chat Doctor.  Hope this will
help you in resolving your query. Thank you

REFERENCE:
Hello, I have gone through your query and understood the concern. In a
28-day cycle, ovulation will occur on the 14th day, i.e., 14 days
before the onset of the next period. Spermatozoa remain active for 3-5
days after ejaculation; please remember that even the pre-ejaculate
contains enough sperm to cause conception during the ovulation or
fertile period. Though you had the intercourse around the fertile
period, the chances of conception are very less considering the fact
that it was slightly far from the probable date of ovulation and also
since the emergency contraception was taken. Though the protection
offered with the pill decreases with time span, yet a good amount of
protection is offered. She may see some with Chat Doctor.  Please do
not stress; just see a specialist for further help if she becomes
overdue by ten days. Take care.

REFERENCE:
Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. By what you quote I
feel that your kid might be having a viral illness...headache at the
height of fever is quite common in this. Fever of few days without any
localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than
fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between
2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing
around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it
doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will
there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is
active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum
ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is
more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever,
especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am
happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on
Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you
can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good

Broncho- vascular marking" indicating that it is Bronchitis. It is
getting difficult for the patient to respire properly. this condition
occurs 3-4 times in a year mostly in summer season in a gap of 10-15
days when she cant respire or take air properly. it took 3 days to get
her well, on 1st day there is indication that there is respiratory
problem, slight noise while respiration but she can walk, talk & even
sleep properly. The next day i.e. Day2, the situation gets worsen &
she even cant talk , walk or even sleep properly. She finds herself
comfortable sitting quitely.The noise of her respiration gets louder
in such condition. On Day3, the condition improves a little bit.
though difficult in walking, but she can talk a little & even sleep
while in sitting condition. By day 4 she started behaving like a
normal person. It has been almost 7-8 years since now, & for the first
time in this year this happened in winter season i.e. in January. She
is getting  Homeopathic treatment  as she finds it comfortable & not
using any inhalers or alopatChatDoctoredicines as she doesnt want to
use that. The period of suffering i.e. 3-4 days remains same in all
the years even while under medical treatment. She is vegeterian & eats
only fish occasionally . Is it related to eating??What is the possible
reason of such condition?? What precautions can we take for her?? any
other treatment or test that should be done?? Kindly suggest your
opinion.

REFERENCE:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your
concern. By your history and description, possibility of seasonal
allergic bronchitis is more in her case. So in my opinion first get
done Pulmonary Function Test (PFT). This will tell you about severity
of the bronchitis. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity
only. She may need inhaled bronchodilators. She may also benefit by
combination of antihistamine and anti-allergic Chat Doctor.  This
should be taken 1 week before season change and continue 1 week after
completion of season. Since all these are prescribed medicines, you
need doctor s prescription for them. So consult doctor, discuss all
these and start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query.

[10] QUESTION:
I am 24 years of age. I had a tumor surgically taken out. After its
biopsy it was found to be pure dysgerminoma. The tumor was confined to
one overy. It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy?
What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate
means the person only has 5 years to live?

REFERENCE:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to take chemotherapy for
dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it
is immature teratoma. However, higher stage is best treated with
chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and
can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of
carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease
and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even
after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended
chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early
stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer
survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient
survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients
can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry.

[11] QUESTION:
Hi My brother is 23 years old. About 5 days ago he got a bruise that
suddenly appeared on on his forearm. He can t recall any bump. It
started small with a blue/black coulour, but it s getting bigger and
bigger. It now has a wine red colour with a white sircle about the
size of a 20c coin in the middle. He says that the bruise and the
white sircle are not sore at all, rather dead. When you press with
your finger on the bruise it doesn t make a white sircle like when you
press with you finger on your skin. There is no sign of any insect
bit. The white area started with a lump, but is now flat after about 5
days. He says that he is very tired and that his muscles are sore. He
also is experiencing back pains and a weird feeling in the back of his
head. He says that it feels as if a vein is going to pop in his head.
Yesterday there were 3 bubbles in the vain just next to the bruise on
his arm. He is also confused and can t remember things, almost like
blackouts. Please tell me what this can be and what the causes can be?

REFERENCE:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. Causes of the Bruises on
the arm with 3 small lumps-As the bruise on your 23 yr old brother
came 5 days back abruptly, without any previous history of any lump,
and as it is getting bigger with wine red color changed from blue
/black, with veins nearby engorged, with muscle soreness and debility,
with disappearance of white central lump in 5 days time, with back
pains and weird headache with blackouts, raises many queries about the
lump being mostly of infective origin, or could it be any silent
malignant melanoma? Or could it be Ringworm infestation?It's very
difficult to comment on such a background unless direct physical
examination from a Dermatologist /or a Surgeon with verification blood
tests confirm it after Second Opinion on such a weird lump. So Second
Opinion on this bruised lump on the arm with 3 small lumps of your
brother, is suggested to you. Hope this reply would help you to plan

Welcome to the ChatDoctorI have gone through your question and
understand your concerns. Don't worry the weight of your baby is not

birth weight. The best food at this age is 4-5 bowls of complementary
feeds along with breastfeeds or formula feeds. It's advisable to eat
from family pot I.e. make your baby sit and eat when whole family eats
at least 3 meals a day. Offer all the staple food that you eat
routinely. Do not reject any food unless and until you feel that the
child is allergic or rejects it constantly. Complementary feeds should
include mashed and buried food which includes cereals, pulses, fruits
and vegetables. Hopefully this will help you. I would be happy to help

Hello there, I am Chat Doctor. Most probable symptoms of malaria is

elemental deficiency causing this type of symptoms. So I suggest you

REFERENCE:
Hello, Nancy, The number that you mention for Bilirubin level 26 seems
wrong. Probably 2.6 mg. You would be extremely jaundiced and in liver
failure if the Bilirubin level was 26 mg. I definitely think you
should get a complete liver profile which includes all the enzymes,
protein, albumin and globulin, blood count, prothrombin time, even
Hepatitis screening. You should also get a sonogram of the liver and
gallbladder to rule out gallstones and fatty liver. Especially fatty
foods can trigger gallbladder attacks. Hope this will be of assistance

fingers and feet (numbness). My oncologist stopped the chemo 3 weeks
ago. I am scheduled to see a neurologist next Monday. Have I waited
too late to enhance reversal od the nerve damage?

REFERENCE:
Hi, Generally, if the medication causing these PARESTHESIA (tingling)
and NUMBNESS (neuropathy) is stopped fairly soon after symptoms begin
then, there is a regression of symptoms.  However, there's no good way
to PREDICT before a person receives the treatment whether these
symptoms may present or if they do what their severity or longevity
may be.  In some cases, symptoms do turn out to be prolonged and even
permanent. What you can ask your doctor to also do (aside from
stopping the medication) is to check you metabolically for several
things. Such as Vitamin B12, folate, TSH, FT4, and vitamin D since if
these are low in levels they will exacerbate symptoms of neuropathy
induced by other agents and make it difficult to reverse.  Hope I have
answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

[20] QUESTION:
Visibly swollen lymph nodes all over. CBC count shows high wbc, mono
absolute, Neo absolute, Eos absolute, MPV. Some have have tripled
since last CBC. Was told it was a kidney infection and given Cipro,
this helped the lymphs that were painful, the others remained. For
instance the lymphs in  my arm by my elbow you can visually see them
and they are about 1 inch long (2 of them) this is on both sides, the
left is worst. I have strange pains in my left side of abdomnen, in
the crease in my thigh, shoulders, legs and back. When I sit back in a
chair it feels as if I am leaining on a ball and it is pusing into my
lower back. I have tingly sensations where I think the lymphs are at.
My joints are starting to hurt (think from the Cipro). Vision is
getting worse, mild temp, occasional hot flashes. I also have had
shortness of breath since this has started. My CBC count was abnormal
from a stomach pain that woke me from my sleep months ago, since then
most of the levels have tripled that were high before. I also get
these weird hot tingle sensations on my breast. I cant keep being told
it is nothing. I cant afford to go to the doctors over and over and
not get anything healed. Any suggestions or thought of what this may
be? I feel like my doctor and ER are blowing it off.

REFERENCE:
Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as
follows.1. Infection can cause lymph nodes enlargement.2. Depending on
type of infection, neutrophil or lymphocytes will increase, which will
cause overall increased WBC count.3. Better to get lymph node FNAC for
evaluation of course. Multiple lymph nodes, lymphoma needs to be
excluded.4. Differential count of WBC and FNAC result necessary for
further opinion Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help
again

ovulation occurred. All the other investigations also seem to be fine,
except that the FSH is on the higher side (should be less than 10)You
should get your husbands semen analysis testing done. Also, it is
essential to check patency of your fallopian tubes (via laparoscopy).
If tubes are patent, you can proceed with ovulation induction 3
cycles, else, please consider IVF / Quill the best.

[23] QUESTION:
My wife is 36 years old. She got pregnancy 2 years back and due to
PROM (Premature Rapture of Membrane), she had to loss her pregnancy at
early 7th month. Since then she dint get pregnancy and today her
doctor given her the FERTIGYN 5000 injection . Please let me know the
use of this injection. Also please let me know the chances for her to
get pregnancy again. Many thanks in advance.

REFERENCE:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Your wife has conceived before, so there
are definitely the chances that sh will get pregnancy again. Though as
age advances, the good quality of ruptured Ovum, and frequency of
Ovulation reduces. Could the Doctor find the reason for PROM?PROM, has
several causes-like infection in the chorionic membrane, excessive
liquor (water bag), twins, etc.? Does she have any medical or hormonal
Disorder ? Your Doctor has given her In Foreign. That Injection is
given at the time of LH Surge, which we can know by Blood Hormonal (LH
and Estradiol) level, BBT (basal body Temperature) ovulation reading,
home ovulation test and Trans-vaginal follicular study. LH Surge
indicates that Ovulation is impending within 24-48 hours. Sometimes,
ova matures, and develop, but unable to release from ovary. This
injection makes sure that ova releases from the ovary, so it enhances
the chances of fertilization. Best of Luck

my father has a black spot in his mouth between the gum and cheek
line.  He used to be a smoker but has quit for 25 yrs.  but did smoke
for 30 yrs.     he also had radiation for a tumor behind his ear 3yrs
ago.   Could this black spot in his mouth be cancer?

REFERENCE:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your
concern. Since your father was having ear cancer and past smoker,
black spot in mouth may be the sign of early cancer. So better to
consult doctor and get done clinical examination of oral cavity and
black spot. If needed, biopsy and histopathological examination of the
black spot should be done to rule out cancer. So consult doctor and
discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health

[25] QUESTION:
I have these black spots on the tip of my tongue--had them for so many
years--at times there would be more spots and at times less. I use a
tongue cleaner every day, but no results. How do I get rid of these
black spots on the tip of my tongue?

REFERENCE:
Hias you have mentioned black spots, so they may be disclosed papillae
due to some adverse affect of any Chat Doctor.  It can be due to some
sort of nutritional deficiency also. You have mentioned that you use a
tongue cleaner with no effect. So it's clear that they are not
superficial but deep within the surface. If they are asymptomatic and
are not increasing in their size, then no need to worry. If for
esthetic purposes, you want them removed, you can contact some dentist
with laser specialty.  With regards
